## Submission Instructions
* Work in a fork of this repository
* Work in a branch on your fork
* Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
* Submit a pull request to this repository
* Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
* Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on canvas

## Requirements
#### Feature Tasks
##### expense
* in this app an expense should contain at least the following properties
  * `id` a uuid
  * `categoryID` an id that corresponds to an existing category
  * `timestamp` a date from when the category was created
  * `name` a string that is the name of the category
  * `price` a number that is the total amount of $ in the category
  * feel free to add more to your expense

##### redux
###### app reducer
* export a reducer that holds the entire app state from `reducer/index.js`
* create a reducer that will combine your categories reducer and expenses reducer

###### expenses reducer
* create a category reducer in your your reducer directory
* this reducer should support the following interactions
  * `EXPENSE_CREATE` -- store an expense
  * `EXPENSE_UPDATE` -- update an existing expense
  * `EXPENSE_DELETE` -- delete an existing expense
* if you need others feel free to add them

###### action creators
* you should create an action creator for each interaction supported by your expenses reducer

###### store
* in `lib/store.js` exports a function that will return a redux store from your app reducer

##### Components
Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram.
```
App
  Provider
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
           [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems
              ExpenseForm -- for updating an expense
```

###### Update the CategoryItem Component
* should keep all of the features described in lab-31
* add an ExpenseForm to your category item that enables the user to create expenses on your app state
* display a list of all the ExpenseItems belonging to the category


##### ExpenseForm Component
* should have an `onComplete` prop that will be invoked with the form state onSubmit
* should support an `expense` prop that will both set the initial form state, and update the state in the hook on `componentWillReceiveProps()`
* should have a `buttonText` prop that will configure the submit buttons text

##### ExpenseItem Component
* should have a button that will delete the expense from the Apps `onClick`
* should display the `name` and `price` of the component
* should display an ExpenseForm that will enable the user to update the expense in the app state

#### Test
* Test your ExpenseForm and CategoryForm
* Test all of your action creators
* Test each reducer used in your combineReducers

####  Documentation
Write a description of the project in your README.md
